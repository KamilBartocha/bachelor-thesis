## Thesis title:
Learning Support Vector Machine in Krein spaces

## Abstract:
The work discusses the algorythm of the Support Vector Machine in Krein spaces. For this purpose, the idea of the operation of SVM in linear spaces and in Hilbert spaces is presented. The second chapter deals with the elements of Krein's theory and about Gram matrices. Then, the possibility of defining SVM as projection in Krein spaces was analyzed and the consequences of such a solution were examined

## Key words:
operator of projection, Krein space, indefinite inner product, Gram matrix
